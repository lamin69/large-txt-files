I have a project in my synology nas i have internet box (redbysfr) that it has lanoline phone include i am looking for a way to use docker to install some sort of virtual phone inside docker that I can connect to via android app like grandstream or voip . I need to find a peace of hardware that has a classic phone plug that should be mount in synology to receive phone service frontière the isp box and can be configured inside  a docker container 
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 You want to use your Synology NAS (with Docker) as a sort of virtual PBX:

Your ISP box (Red by SFR) provides a landline phone port (RJ11).

You’d like to bridge that analog phone line into a VoIP system running inside Docker on Synology (e.g., Asterisk, FreePBX, or 3CX).

Then you want to connect Android SIP clients (like Grandstream Wave, Zoiper, Linphone, etc.) to that PBX.

This is doable, but you’ll need an FXO (Foreign Exchange Office) interface — that’s the hardware that converts the analog RJ11 phone line from your ISP box into a digital SIP/VoIP stream that your PBX software can understand.

🔑 Hardware you need
FXO Gateway (standalone SIP gateway):

Small network device that connects your RJ11 line and exposes it as SIP.

Example:

Grandstream HT813 (1× FXO + 1× FXS)

Cisco/Linksys SPA3102 (older but still works)

Sangoma Vega / Patton SmartNode (higher end, more expensive)

These register the analog line to your PBX (running in Docker) over the LAN.
This is the most plug-and-play solution.

FXO PCI/USB card (inside the NAS):

Not practical with Synology because they don’t accept PCI cards, and USB-FXO devices have very poor driver support inside Docker.

I wouldn’t recommend going this route unless you run a dedicated server.

🔑 Software inside Docker
On Synology, you can run:

Asterisk (lightweight, DIY config)

FreePBX (full web GUI, more beginner friendly)

3CX (also works in Docker, but licensing may be a concern)

In the PBX, you will:

Register the FXO gateway as a SIP trunk.

Create extensions for your Android clients (e.g., Zoiper, Grandstream Wave).

Set up inbound/outbound rules so that calls from the landline go to your apps, and calls from your apps go out through the landline.

🔧 Network setup
Synology + FXO gateway must be on the same LAN.

Make sure SIP ports (usually 5060 UDP) are open internally.

For remote access outside your home, you’ll need either:

A VPN back into your LAN (simplest & most secure), or

SIP exposed via port forwarding (less secure, requires hardening like fail2ban).

✅ Summary (best setup for you):

Buy a Grandstream HT813 (or similar FXO gateway).

Connect the RJ11 phone port from your Red by SFR box into the FXO port of the HT813.

Run FreePBX in Docker on your Synology.

Configure the HT813 as a SIP trunk to FreePBX.

Connect Android SIP clients (Zoiper, Grandstream Wave, etc.) as extensions.

Do you want me to draft a step-by-step setup guide (Docker container setup + HT813 config + FreePBX trunk/extension config), or are you mainly trying to decide which hardware is best before going further?

You said:
For explanation my sip doesn't allow sip calls only the ips handles them what i get from the isp box is Rj11 to connect to the ATA with a lan port connected to the isp router . my question is how will the docker container connect to the ata will be able to make calls once I configured the asterisk container ? Without the need to plug ATA directly to synology ?
ChatGPT said:
Perfect clarification 👍
You’re absolutely right:

Your ISP does not give you SIP credentials → you can’t register directly to SFR’s SIP servers.

The RJ11 analog port on the ISP box is the only way to access the phone service.

That means you must convert that RJ11 analog line into SIP yourself.

That’s exactly the role of the ATA/FXO gateway.

How the connection works (no physical plug into Synology needed)
The ATA (e.g., Grandstream HT813, Linksys SPA3102, etc.) sits on your LAN and acts as a SIP endpoint:

RJ11 cable from ISP box → into FXO port of the ATA.

This carries the analog phone line.

Ethernet cable from ATA → into your LAN (same network as Synology).

Now the ATA becomes reachable over IP, just like any other SIP phone.

In Asterisk (Docker on Synology):

You configure the ATA as a SIP trunk.

Asterisk communicates with the ATA using SIP over LAN, not USB or direct RJ11.

Your Android SIP apps connect to Asterisk as extensions.

When you dial out, Asterisk routes the call → SIP trunk → ATA → analog line → ISP box → PSTN.

When a call comes in, ATA detects it → passes it via SIP → Asterisk → routes it to your Android app(s).

✅ Key point
👉 The ATA does not plug into Synology directly.
It’s just another network device on your LAN, speaking SIP.
Your Asterisk container on Synology only needs IP connectivity to it.

Example setup
ISP Box (Red by SFR) → RJ11 → HT813 (FXO)

HT813 (Ethernet) → Router (same LAN as Synology)

Synology (Docker Asterisk) ↔ SIP ↔ HT813

Android SIP clients ↔ SIP ↔ Asterisk

No special hardware on Synology required.

Would you like me to sketch you a network diagram + example FreePBX/Asterisk config for this setup so you see exactly how ATA ↔ Docker ↔ SIP client will link together?

🔑 Flow of Calls
Inbound Call (someone calls your landline number):

Call enters ISP box via analog line.

ISP box sends ringing voltage on RJ11.

ATA (FXO port) detects it → converts to SIP call.

ATA sends SIP INVITE to Asterisk in Docker.

Asterisk routes call → rings your Android SIP app.

Outbound Call (you call from Android app):

Android app sends SIP INVITE to Asterisk.

Asterisk routes via ATA SIP trunk.

ATA dials the number via RJ11 analog.

ISP box handles the rest to PSTN.

⚙️ Example Configuration
1. HT813 (ATA Gateway)
Set to FXO mode (line from ISP → FXO).

Configure SIP trunk to point to Asterisk (Synology IP).

Example:

SIP Server: 192.168.1.100 (Synology NAS IP)

SIP User/Password: something simple, e.g., trunkuser / trunkpass

2. Asterisk/FreePBX (Docker on Synology)
Create a SIP trunk with credentials matching the ATA.

Create extensions (e.g., 101, 102, etc.) for Android SIP clients.

Add inbound/outbound routes:

Inbound → ring group or directly to extension.

Outbound → send via ATA trunk.

3. Android SIP Client (Zoiper, GS Wave)
Register with Asterisk using extension credentials.

Example:

SIP Server: 192.168.1.100 (Synology)

Username: 101

Password: secret

✅ With this setup, the ATA acts like a “translator box” between the ISP analog phone line and your Docker PBX. Everything else is pure SIP over LAN.

👉 Do you want me to also prepare a docker-compose.yaml example for running FreePBX or Asterisk on Synology, so you can directly deploy the PBX part?

You said:
What's the reference between Grandstream HT813 and Grandstream HT812 in my case will both device work for me 
ChatGPT said:
Great question 👍 because the HT812 and HT813 look almost the same, but the difference is critical for your use case.

⚖️ HT812 vs HT813
🔹 Grandstream HT812
2× FXS ports (to connect analog telephones or fax machines).

No FXO port.

Purpose: turn SIP accounts into classic analog phone lines.

✅ Good if you already have SIP accounts from a VoIP provider and just want to keep using old telephones.

❌ Not suitable for connecting your ISP’s RJ11 analog line (because no FXO).

🔹 Grandstream HT813
1× FXS port (for an analog phone).

1× FXO port (for plugging in an analog line from the ISP box).

Purpose:

FXO = bring your ISP analog line into SIP/Asterisk.

FXS = optionally connect an old analog handset if you want.

✅ Perfect for your use case (converting Red by SFR RJ11 phone line into SIP for Asterisk).

🚦 Which one do you need?
👉 Only the HT813 will work for your situation, because it has an FXO port.
The HT812 will not work, since it can’t accept the RJ11 line coming out of your ISP box.

Think of it this way:

FXO = plugs into the wall / ISP box (line IN).

FXS = plugs into a telephone (line OUT).

You need FXO to capture the landline → so HT813 is mandatory.

Do you want me to also show you how the HT813 FXO/FXS ports should be wired in your setup (with your Red SFR box, Synology Docker, and maybe a classic phone)?

You said:
How many calls can ht813 supports
ChatGPT said:
Good thinking 👌 — because ATAs are small devices, they have some limits.

📊 Grandstream HT813 Call Capacity
FXO port (RJ11 from ISP line):

Supports only 1 analog line.

That means 1 active call at a time can go in/out through the FXO.

If you’re already on a call, a second incoming caller will get a busy tone (unless your ISP line has a call waiting service, in which case the ATA can signal it).

FXS port (RJ11 to analog phone):

Can be used for 1 analog phone.

But in your scenario (using Asterisk + Android apps), you don’t really need this port unless you also want to keep a classic phone connected.

VoIP/SIP side (LAN, to Asterisk):

The HT813 can register 2 SIP accounts and handle 2 SIP sessions simultaneously.

Example: 1 SIP call could be linked to the FXO (landline), while another SIP call goes out to an FXS phone.

✅ What this means for you
From the landline (Red by SFR), you can handle one call at a time, since the ISP only gives you one analog line via RJ11.

Within your Asterisk PBX, you can have multiple extensions/apps, but only one of them can use the landline at the same time.

Internal SIP-to-SIP calls (between Android apps/extensions) don’t touch the ATA, so they are unlimited (just depend on your PBX/NAS performance).

⚡ If you need more than one simultaneous landline call, you’d need:

A device with multiple FXO ports (e.g., Grandstream GXW-4104 with 4× FXO), or

Multiple HT813s (each handling one analog line).

Do you want me to map out how calls would be distributed (e.g., one landline call shared among several SIP apps inside Asterisk) so you see the practical limits clearly?

You said:
What docker image will perfectly suit the HT813 to match the hardware and audio codes for the best audio experience? 
ChatGPT said:
Excellent point ⚡️ — because the choice of Docker image (and PBX software) matters for codec support, stability, and interoperability with the Grandstream HT813.

🔹 What the HT813 supports
According to Grandstream specs:

Voice Codecs: G.711µ/a-law, G.722 (wideband), G.723.1, G.726-32, G.729A/B, iLBC, Opus, GSM.

Fax: T.38 and Pass-Through.

DTMF: In-band, RFC2833, SIP INFO.

So the ATA is very flexible. For best audio quality:

Internal calls (SIP app ↔ SIP app): use Opus or G.722 (HD audio).

Landline calls (via FXO): limited by PSTN to G.711 (a-law in France).

🔹 Recommended Docker PBX Images
✅ 1. FreePBX (Asterisk + GUI)
Docker Image: tiredofit/freepbx (well-maintained, production ready).

Why:

GUI makes configuration of trunks, extensions, codecs very easy.

Directly compatible with HT813.

Supports all major codecs including G.711, G.722, Opus.

Best for: If you want an easier time managing trunks and routes.

✅ 2. Plain Asterisk
Docker Image: andrius/asterisk or official community builds.

Why:

Lightweight, no GUI bloat.

Perfect if you’re comfortable editing sip.conf and extensions.conf.

Best for: Advanced users, scripting, or lightweight deployments.

✅ 3. 3CX (Free edition)
There’s an official 3CX Docker image.

Why:

Enterprise-grade, polished UI.

Native mobile apps.

Supports G.711/G.722/Opus.

But: Free edition has some limitations (max calls, some features locked).

🔹 Audio Codec Strategy (for best experience)
Trunk (HT813 ↔ Asterisk)

Set preferred codec to G.711a (PCMA) — this matches the French PSTN and avoids transcoding.

Extensions (Android SIP apps ↔ Asterisk)

Allow Opus > G.722 > G.711a.

This way:

Internal calls = HD (Opus or G.722).

External landline calls = G.711a (no unnecessary transcoding).

Disable low-quality codecs (GSM, G.723, etc.) unless you really need them for bandwidth savings.

🚀 My Recommendation for You
Use tiredofit/freepbx Docker image on your Synology.

Configure the HT813 as a SIP trunk with G.711a only.

Configure your Android clients with Opus/G.722 + fallback to G.711a.

Result:

HD voice internally.

Perfect PSTN compatibility externally.

No transcoding overhead = stable + best quality.

👉 Do you want me to prepare a ready-to-run docker-compose.yaml for FreePBX (optimized with codec settings for HT813)?

🔑 Notes
Volumes

All FreePBX/Asterisk data will persist in /volume1/docker/freePBX.

Network

Uses your macvlan_new network with a fixed IP 192.168.1.135.

You’ll reach FreePBX Web UI at http://192.168.1.135.

Codecs

Asterisk codec preference is set to:

Internal calls = Opus → G.722 (HD quality).

External (HT813 trunk) = alaw (G.711a) (French PSTN standard).

Database

This uses embedded MariaDB (simpler, fewer containers).

If you want a separate MariaDB container, we can adjust.

RTP Ports

10000–20000 UDP reserved for media (internal only, no need to expose since macvlan puts the container on your LAN).

⚡ After startup:

Access FreePBX at http://192.168.1.135

Default login is created during setup; you’ll be prompted to set admin credentials.

From there, configure:

SIP trunk = HT813 (set to alaw only).

Extensions = Android SIP apps with opus,g722,alaw.

👉 Do you want me to also include a sample FreePBX trunk config (for HT813) and an extension template for your Android SIP apps so you can paste them straight into the GUI?

How to run run it and name it freePBX 
ChatGPT said:
Great — let’s make sure you can actually launch this container on your Synology NAS and have it show up as freePBX.

📦 Steps to Run FreePBX (container name: freePBX)
Save the file

On your Synology, create a file called docker-compose.yaml

Put it in /volume1/docker/freePBX/ (same directory where you want data to live).

Example structure:

/volume1/docker/freePBX/
  ├── docker-compose.yaml
  └── (persistent data will be created here automatically)
Open SSH to Synology

Enable SSH in DSM (if not already).

SSH into your Synology with:

ssh adminuser@<your-nas-ip>
Go into the folder

cd /volume1/docker/freePBX
Launch the container

docker-compose up -d
-d means detached (runs in background).

The service will be named freepbx because of:

container_name: freepbx
Check that it’s running

docker ps
You should see something like:

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND   STATUS   PORTS   NAMES
abc123def456   tiredofit/freepbx:latest    ...       Up ...           freepbx
Access FreePBX Web UI

Open your browser to:
👉 http://192.168.1.135

The FreePBX initial setup wizard will appear (set admin password, configure extensions, etc.).

⚠️ Important Notes
Since you’re on macvlan_new with static IP 192.168.1.135, there’s no need to expose ports in docker-compose. The container is directly on your LAN.

Make sure no other device on your LAN is using 192.168.1.135.

If you ever want to stop it:

docker-compose down
👉 Do you want me to add a ready-made FreePBX trunk config snippet (for the HT813) that you can paste into FreePBX once it’s up, so you don’t have to guess the SIP settings?

You said:
Does it take much time since I run the command up to access web gui
ChatGPT said:
Good question 👍 — FreePBX in Docker does take a bit of time to get ready, especially the very first time you run it.

⏱️ Startup Timeline (on first run)
Pulling image (tiredofit/freepbx:latest):
A few minutes depending on your internet speed (~1–2 GB image).

Container init:

Starts Apache, PHP, MariaDB, Asterisk, FreePBX install scripts.

Can take 5–15 minutes the first time.

During this phase, if you visit http://192.168.1.135, you may get:

Connection refused

Blank page

Or a half-loaded installer

Subsequent restarts:
Much faster (~1–2 minutes), because data and database are already initialized in /volume1/docker/freePBX.

🔍 How to check progress
Run:

docker logs -f freepbx
You’ll see messages like:

Starting MariaDB…

Starting Asterisk…

Installing FreePBX…

FreePBX installation complete

Once you see Listening on 0.0.0.0:80, the Web GUI should be accessible.

✅ What to Expect
First launch → 10 minutes is normal before the Web GUI is fully usable.

After that, restarts are quick (1–2 min).

👉 Do you want me to also show you the very first steps inside the FreePBX GUI once it loads (admin password setup + where to add the HT813 trunk)?

You said:
Can I add time stamp in terminal for docker logs -f freepbx
ChatGPT said:
Yes! You can add timestamps to docker logs so you can see exactly when each line was logged.

The command is:

docker logs -f --timestamps freepbx
🔹 Explanation
-f → follow logs in real time.

--timestamps → adds the date & time at the beginning of each log line.

Example output:

2025-08-17T15:23:45.123456789Z Starting MariaDB...
2025-08-17T15:23:50.987654321Z Starting Asterisk...
2025-08-17T15:24:05.123456789Z FreePBX installation complete
✅ Very useful for tracking how long each step of the startup takes.

If you want, I can give you a version that also shows elapsed time between log lines, which is even more handy for monitoring FreePBX startup. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
What's the default user / password
ChatGPT said:
For the tiredofit/freepbx Docker image, there isn’t a “universal” default password — the container usually prompts you to set it during the first web GUI login.

Here’s the breakdown:

🔹 Default Login
Username: admin

Password: Usually empty at first (leave blank) or it may be randomly generated in the logs.

You can check the initial password in the container logs:

docker logs freepbx | grep "Password for admin"
It often prints something like:

Admin password: <randomly-generated-password>
🔹 Recommended
Once you access the Web GUI at http://192.168.1.135, set a strong admin password immediately.

Optionally, you can also predefine a password by adding an environment variable in your docker-compose.yaml:

environment:
  - ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourStrongPasswordHere
Then restart the container:

docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
This will let you log in as admin with the password you specified.

Do you want me to update your docker-compose.yaml to include a fixed admin password so you don’t have to check logs at first login?

Search in the internet if there is an image from grandstream ucm if someone manage to export the image from ucm and made it as docker image to be used 
ChatGPT said:
As of now, there isn't an official or community-supported Docker image for Grandstream UCM series PBXs (like UCM6200 or UCM6300). Grandstream's UCM devices are typically hardware-based and not designed for containerization. While some users have explored running UCM firmware on virtual machines or custom hardware setups, these methods are not officially supported and may not provide the full functionality or stability expected from Grandstream's hardware appliances.
Multilink

If you're looking for a software-based PBX solution that can be run in Docker, you might consider alternatives like Asterisk or FreePBX, which are widely used and have robust community support. These platforms can be configured to work with various SIP devices, including Grandstream phones and ATAs.

For instance, FreePBX has a Docker image available that can be set up to handle SIP trunks and extensions. This setup can be configured to work with your Grandstream HT813 ATA, allowing you to connect to your ISP's analog line and manage internal and external calls through a software-based PBX.

If you need assistance setting up FreePBX in Docker or configuring it to work with your Grandstream HT813 ATA, feel free to ask!

What android can i use with freepbx 
ChatGPT said:
You have a lot of good options for Android SIP clients that work well with FreePBX. Since you want high-quality audio (Opus/G.722) and compatibility with your HT813 setup, here’s a breakdown:

🔹 Recommended Android SIP Apps for FreePBX
App	Pros	Notes
Zoiper (free + paid)	Very stable, supports Opus/G.722, TLS/SRTP	Free version has some limitations; Pro unlocks HD codecs and push notifications
Grandstream Wave	Free, native support for Grandstream devices	Can auto-provision with Grandstream PBXs; supports HD codecs
Linphone	Open-source, supports Opus/G.722, SRTP	Lightweight, very configurable, can import FreePBX config manually
CSipSimple (older, open-source)	Lightweight, HD audio	No longer actively maintained but works for basic SIP
Bria Mobile (by CounterPath, paid)	Professional-grade, HD audio, encryption, push	Very reliable for business environments
Acrobits Softphone	Supports Opus/G.722, push notifications	Paid, professional, stable for multiple extensions
🔹 Recommendations for Your Setup
Internal calls (SIP app ↔ SIP app on LAN): Use Opus or G.722 for HD audio.

External calls via HT813 (analog line → FreePBX → SIP app): Use G.711 a-law (matches PSTN in France).

🔹 How to Connect to FreePBX
Create an extension in FreePBX for each Android SIP app.

Configure SIP username/password in the app.

Set preferred codecs: Opus, G.722, G.711a.

Make sure your Android device is on the same LAN as your FreePBX Docker container (192.168.1.135).

If you want, I can make a step-by-step guide showing how to set up Zoiper or Grandstream Wave with your FreePBX Docker container, including the exact codec settings for HD audio and PSTN calls.

Do you want me to do that?

Ah, perfect — that screenshot is the Grandstream Wave login screen. I can guide you step by step to connect it to your FreePBX Docker container.

1️⃣ Understanding the fields
Field	What to put for FreePBX
Domain / Server	IP address of your FreePBX container: 192.168.1.135
Account	The extension number you created in FreePBX (e.g., 1001)
Password	The password for that extension (not the admin password)
⚠️ Don’t use the FreePBX admin login here — Wave only logs in to an extension.

2️⃣ Create an extension in FreePBX
Go to the FreePBX GUI → Applications → Extensions → Add New Extension → Generic SIP Device

Choose an extension number (e.g., 1001)

Set a strong secret/password

Submit & Apply Config

3️⃣ Configure Grandstream Wave
Open Wave → Add Account → choose SIP account

Fill in:

Domain/Server: 192.168.1.135

Account: 1001

Password: your extension password

Optional: under Advanced Settings, make sure Transport = UDP (default)

Save and enable the account

4️⃣ Test
If everything is on the same LAN, Wave should register immediately.

If it fails, check:

FreePBX firewall (in Docker)

Make sure the macvlan network allows your phone’s IP to reach the container

Use the Asterisk CLI inside the container to see if the extension is registering:

docker exec -it freepbx asterisk -rvvv
sip show peers
You should see your extension listed as OK.

If you want, I can draw a simple diagram showing the FreePBX Docker container, the HT813, and the Android phone registering via Grandstream Wave — that usually makes it much clearer.

Do you want me to do that?

Following up the above thread HT813 i already have tp-link router that has rj11 can I used it to talk to freepbx to act like HT813 ?
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 thanks for clarifying. Let’s break this down carefully:

🔹 What the Grandstream HT813 does
It’s an ATA (Analog Telephone Adapter).

It has:

FXS port → where you plug a regular analog phone.

FXO port → where you plug the RJ11 line from your ISP box.

Inside, it translates analog (RJ11) ↔ SIP (VoIP) so that FreePBX (or any IP-PBX) can use it as a SIP trunk or endpoint.

🔹 What your TP-Link router with RJ11 probably is
Most TP-Link “RJ11 routers” are actually DSL modem-routers (RJ11 = DSL line) or sometimes VoIP-enabled routers.

If it’s just a DSL port, then it cannot act like an HT813.

If it has VoIP (FXS/FXO) support, you’d need to check if it can register as a SIP endpoint. Usually, consumer routers with RJ11 only let you plug in a phone and use the ISP’s built-in SIP service — they do not expose that as a standard SIP trunk you can connect to FreePBX.

🔹 Why you need something like HT813
Your ISP box only gives you RJ11 analog (not SIP credentials). FreePBX is SIP-only.
That’s exactly why the HT813 exists: it’s the translator in between.
Without an ATA (HT813, Cisco SPA3102, etc.), FreePBX won’t be able to talk to the analog line.

✅ So the short answer:

Your TP-Link with RJ11 cannot replace the HT813 (unless it’s a very specific enterprise VoIP router that supports SIP FXO trunking — very rare in consumer gear).

You’ll still need an ATA like the Grandstream HT813 to connect FreePBX to your ISP’s RJ11 analog line.

Do you want me to draw you a diagram of the working setup (ISP Box → HT813 → FreePBX → Android softphone) so you can visualize why the ATA is required?

Search online for tp-link router that can act like HT813
ChatGPT said:
I looked into whether there’s a TP-Link router that can act similarly to the Grandstream HT813 (i.e., function as an FXO ATA to bridge your ISP’s analog RJ-11 line into FreePBX).

TP-Link Options: What Exists vs. What You Need
1. TP-Link TD-VG3631 — A VoIP-Enabled DSL Modem/Router
This is one of the few TP-Link products featuring FXO and FXS ports:

1 FXO port — can connect your ISP's analog phone line.

2 FXS ports — for connecting analog phones.

Also acts as an ADSL modem, wireless router, and VoIP gateway.
TP-Link

While it technically could accept your analog line, its firmware is designed for consumer ISP scenarios (like translating your analog line into a built-in VoIP service). It does not expose a clean SIP trunk compatible with FreePBX, and isn't intended for full PBX integration.

2. Other TP-Link Routers (Archer, Deco, etc.)
These models typically support adding VoIP accounts (SIP providers) via the router UI. However:

They are aimed at routing calls via a VoIP provider.

They lack FXO hardware to accept your analog phone line directly.

They can't act as a PBX trunk toward FreePBX.
TP-Link
Super User

Conclusion
Use Case	Works?	Comment
Bridging analog line via FXO	Yes (TD-VG3631 only)	But not ideal for PBX integration due to firmware limitations.
Acting as a SIP trunk to FreePBX	No	TP-Link routers aren’t designed for this role.
So while the TD-VG3631 technically includes the hardware (FXO/FXS), it’s not a practical replacement for the HT813 in a PBX setup.

Best Choice for Your Setup
If your goal is to connect your ISP’s analog RJ-11 line into FreePBX properly, your best solution remains:

Grandstream HT813 — reliable, SIP-compatible FXO ATA.

Or, for scalability: multiple FXO ports (e.g., Grandstream GXW-4104, Yeastar TA810, or Patton SmartNode).

You said:
In HT813 apart from routine my analog phone line to freepbx as sip truck can I add other sip account into HT813 or its just practical to add them directly to freepbx
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question 👍

The HT813 has two roles:

FXO (WAN line) → your ISP analog line (RJ11 IN).

This you normally connect into FreePBX as a SIP trunk.

FXS (Phone port) → for plugging in a normal analog phone (RJ11 OUT).

This port can also register to a SIP server (like FreePBX or even a third-party provider).

🔹 SIP Account Handling on HT813
The FXS port can register to one SIP account (like an extension in FreePBX, or directly to an ITSP).

The FXO port is used to bring your analog PSTN line into FreePBX as a SIP trunk.

So yes, technically you can configure the FXS port of the HT813 to register with an external SIP provider (like OVH, Sipgate, etc.), bypassing FreePBX.

🔹 But in practice…
If you already run FreePBX, it’s more flexible and practical to register all SIP accounts (ISP trunks, VoIP providers, etc.) directly into FreePBX, not the HT813.

FreePBX then handles:

Multiple SIP trunks

Inbound/outbound routing

Extensions (your softphones, desk phones, Wave app)

Codecs, voicemail, IVR, call routing, etc.

The HT813 should just act as a gateway:

FXO → FreePBX SIP trunk (so FreePBX can use the analog line).

FXS → either left unused, or registered as a FreePBX extension if you want to keep one physical analog phone in your setup.

✅ Best Practice Recommendation:

Put all SIP accounts into FreePBX (centralized control).

Use HT813 only for what it’s best at: bridging analog → SIP.

Optional: connect a traditional analog phone to the FXS port, register it to FreePBX as an extension.

👉 Would you like me to sketch a diagram of the optimal setup (FreePBX in Docker at the center, HT813 as FXO/FXS gateway, SIP trunks, Android apps)? That might make it crystal clear.

You said:
Okay . I have a subscription front 3cx the free plan I want to add it as sip truck to my freepbx
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👌 That’s a very interesting use-case: using your 3CX subscription as a SIP trunk inside FreePBX. Let’s go through it step by step.

🔹 Important Things to Know
3CX Free Plan is normally designed to register phones or gateways to 3CX, not the other way around.

It’s a PBX in the cloud → expects endpoints (extensions, phones, gateways) to register to it.

It does not usually expose a classic SIP trunk to another PBX.

But there’s a workaround:

You can make FreePBX act like an extension inside 3CX.

That way, FreePBX “registers” as a SIP client to 3CX, and you can then route calls in and out via that “trunk.”

🔹 Setup Steps
1. Create an Extension in 3CX
Log into your 3CX Admin portal.

Go to Extensions → Add Extension.

Give it a number (e.g., 2001) and set a password/secret.

Note the SIP server address (your 3CX domain/IP) and SIP port (usually 5060).

2. Add 3CX as a SIP Trunk in FreePBX
In FreePBX GUI:

Connectivity → Trunks → Add SIP (chan_pjsip) Trunk

General:

Trunk Name: 3CX

pjsip Settings → General:

Username: 2001 (the extension you created)

Secret: (the extension’s password from 3CX)

SIP Server: your 3CX server address (e.g., my3cx.3cx.eu)

SIP Server Port: 5060

SIP Transport: UDP (or TLS if 3CX requires it)

Advanced:

Codecs → enable G711a and G711u (since 3CX defaults to those)

Disable video if not needed

3. Outbound Route in FreePBX
Go to Connectivity → Outbound Routes.

Add a new route:

Route name: to-3cx

Trunk sequence: 3CX

Dial patterns: e.g., 9|. (to dial 9 before numbers and send to 3CX)

4. Inbound Route in FreePBX
If 3CX can forward calls from outside numbers to your extension (2001), then FreePBX will receive them as inbound calls.

Configure Connectivity → Inbound Routes → point to your FreePBX extensions/IVR.

5. Verify with Asterisk CLI
Run inside your FreePBX container:

docker exec -it freepbx asterisk -rvvv
pjsip show registrations
You should see your FreePBX registering to 3CX as extension 2001.

🔹 Practical Note
This works, but it’s not the most natural use of 3CX.

Normally you’d pick one PBX (3CX or FreePBX) and stick with it.

Using 3CX only as a “VoIP provider” is a hack — it might work for lab use or free calling, but it’s fragile compared to using a real SIP provider.

👉 Do you want me to write you the exact FreePBX trunk config (pjsip.conf equivalent) so you can paste/test inside your Docker container, instead of only GUI steps?

You said:
i just got the HT813 i need help to configure it with pbx just hooked the fxo port to isp and lan cable
ChatGPT said:
Nice 🎉 you’ve got the HT813! That’s the key piece to bridge your ISP analog line into FreePBX. Let’s go step by step with your setup:

🔹 1. Physical Connections
FXO port (Line) → connect to the RJ11 from your ISP box (the phone line output).

LAN port (Ethernet) → connect to your switch/router (same LAN as your Synology/FreePBX container).

(Optional) FXS port (Phone) → you can plug in an analog phone just for testing or as a FreePBX extension.

🔹 2. Access HT813 Web UI
Plug a phone into the FXS (Phone) port.

Dial *** (IVR menu).

Dial 02 → it will read out the IP address.

Enter that IP in your browser.

Default login: admin / admin.

Change the password immediately.

🔹 3. Configure the FXO Port (Your PSTN Line → FreePBX)
Go to FXO Port settings in the web UI:

Primary SIP Server: your FreePBX IP (192.168.1.135)

SIP User ID: e.g., trunk1

Authenticate ID: same as above (trunk1)

Authenticate Password: something strong (you’ll enter the same in FreePBX trunk config)

Profile: use Profile 1 (set it to UDP, G711 codec).

This makes the FXO line register as a SIP trunk on FreePBX.

🔹 4. Configure FreePBX (Trunk)
In FreePBX GUI:

Connectivity → Trunks → Add SIP (pjsip) Trunk

General:

Trunk Name: HT813

pjsip Settings → General:

Username: trunk1

Secret: (same password you set in HT813)

SIP Server: IP of HT813 (e.g., 192.168.1.140)

Port to listen: 5060

🔹 5. Outbound Route (to ISP line)
Go to Connectivity → Outbound Routes.

Create route to-ISP.

Trunk sequence → select HT813.

Dial patterns: e.g., 0|. (so dialing 0 + number goes out via the analog line).

🔹 6. Inbound Route (from ISP line)
The HT813 will send incoming PSTN calls to FreePBX.

In FreePBX: Connectivity → Inbound Routes.

Destination → pick an extension, IVR, or ring group.

🔹 7. Test
Inbound: call your ISP line → it should ring your FreePBX extension.

Outbound: from Grandstream Wave (or any FreePBX extension) → dial 0 + number → it should go out the FXO to your ISP.

✅ This way:

FreePBX sees the HT813 FXO port as a SIP trunk.

Calls flow both directions.

Your Android app (Wave or Linphone, Zoiper, etc.) connects only to FreePBX.

⚠️ Question for you before I draft the exact config lines:
👉 Do you want the HT813 to register to FreePBX (HT813 = SIP client), or do you prefer FreePBX to register to the HT813 (FreePBX = client)? Both work, but registration direction changes a few settings.

Which one do you want?

You said:
I DID exactly the same but page status in ht813 :     Port Status:	
Port	Hook	User ID	Registration
FXS	On Hook	0360604603	Not Registered
FXO	Idle	0360604603	Not Registered
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the clear status page dump 🙏 — that explains a lot.
Both FXS and FXO are showing “Not Registered”, which means the HT813 hasn’t successfully connected to FreePBX. That’s the missing piece. Let’s fix it.

🔹 Key Things to Understand
FXO (Line port) = your ISP analog line → needs to register to FreePBX as a SIP trunk.

FXS (Phone port) = optional analog phone → can register as a SIP extension (but only if you want it).

Right now, neither side is registering because the SIP account details in HT813 and FreePBX aren’t matching.

🔹 Step 1: FreePBX Trunk Setup (for FXO)
In FreePBX, create a new pjsip trunk:

Trunk Name: HT813

Username: fxo1

Secret: SuperSecret123

SIP Server: IP of the HT813 (e.g., 192.168.1.140)

Registration: None (because the HT813 will register to FreePBX)

🔹 Step 2: Configure HT813 FXO
In the HT813 web UI → FXO Port:

SIP Server: 192.168.1.135 (your FreePBX container IP)

SIP User ID: fxo1

Authenticate ID: fxo1

Authenticate Password: SuperSecret123

SIP Port: 5060 (default PJSIP port in FreePBX)

NAT Traversal: No (since you’re on the same LAN)

Preferred Vocoder: PCMU, PCMA (G711u/a)

Save → Apply → Reboot HT813.

🔹 Step 3: Check Registration
On FreePBX container, run:

docker exec -it freepbx asterisk -rvvv
pjsip show registrations
You should see something like:

<Registration/ServerURI............................>  <Status>
fxo1/sip:192.168.1.135:5060                         Registered
On the HT813 status page, FXO should now say:

Port   Hook   User ID   Registration
FXO    Idle   fxo1      Registered
🔹 Step 4 (Optional): FXS as a FreePBX Extension
If you want the Phone port for a real analog handset:

Create a new extension in FreePBX (e.g., 201).

Put those credentials into the FXS port settings.

Then that phone can ring as a FreePBX extension.

✅ Once FXO is registered, inbound calls on your analog line will hit FreePBX as a SIP trunk. Outbound routes pointing to the HT813 trunk will send calls out to your ISP.

⚠️ Quick check: in your FreePBX install, do you still have chan_sip enabled, or are you using only pjsip? Because HT813 defaults to SIP UDP/5060, and if FreePBX has chan_sip bound to 5060, registrations will fail.

👉 Can you run this inside Asterisk CLI and paste the result?

pjsip show endpoints
That way I can see if pjsip is listening properly for the HT813.

Perfect 👍 thanks for pasting the pjsip show endpoints output.
Here’s what’s happening:

🔎 What I see
Your HT813 is sending REGISTER to FreePBX with user ID 0360604603.

In FreePBX, you created a PJSIP trunk/endpoint called lamine_fix.

The logs say:

Failed to authenticate
→ which means the username / auth name / password don’t match between HT813 and FreePBX.

✅ Fixing it step by step
1. In FreePBX (Trunk Settings)
Username (Auth ID): fxo1 (example)

Password (Secret): SuperSecret123

SIP Server (host): 192.168.1.135 (your PBX container IP)

Match (permit): 192.168.1.79 (HT813’s LAN IP)

Save → Apply Config.

2. In HT813 (FXO Port tab)
Primary SIP Server: 192.168.1.135

SIP User ID: fxo1

Authenticate ID: fxo1

Authenticate Password: SuperSecret123

Local SIP Port: 5060

Preferred Vocoder: PCMU, PCMA (G711u/a)

Save → Apply → Reboot.

3. Check registration again
On Asterisk CLI:

pjsip show registrations
You should now see:

fxo1/sip:192.168.1.135:5060   Registered
And in the HT813 Status page:

FXO  Idle  fxo1  Registered
⚠️ Right now, the mismatch is because the HT813 is trying to register with 0360604603 but FreePBX expects lamine_fix (or whatever you configured).
👉 The username and auth ID must match exactly on both sides.

Do you want me to give you an exact ready-to-paste FreePBX trunk config with the right [pjsip.conf] equivalent for the HT813? That way you just copy/paste the same credentials into the HT813.

Thanks for pasting the full HT813 config page 🙌
I can see clearly now what’s wrong:

👉 Your HT813 is configured correctly (fxo1 / fxo1 / password), but FreePBX is not matching those credentials.

✅ Step 1 – Create the Trunk in FreePBX
In FreePBX → Connectivity → Trunks → Add Trunk → Add PJSIP Trunk, set:

Trunk Name: HT813_FXO

Username: fxo1

Secret (Password): SuperSecret123

SIP Server: 192.168.1.79 (HT813’s LAN IP)

Authentication: Outbound

Registration: None (⚠️ important — the ATA registers to FreePBX, not the other way)

✅ Step 2 – Create the Extension for the FXO
Instead of using a “Trunk” for registration, it’s much easier to let the FXO register as an extension.

Go to Applications → Extensions → Add Extension → PJSIP

User Extension: fxo1

Secret: SuperSecret123

SIP Server (FreePBX side): leave as default

Transport: UDP

Save → Apply Config.

✅ Step 3 – Point HT813 to FreePBX
In your HT813 FXO Port page (what you pasted):

Primary SIP Server: 192.168.1.135 (FreePBX IP)

SIP User ID: fxo1

Authenticate ID: fxo1

Authenticate Password: SuperSecret123

Local SIP Port: 5060

SIP Registration: Yes

Save → Apply → Reboot HT813.

✅ Step 4 – Check Registration
On FreePBX CLI:

asterisk -rvvv
pjsip show registrations
pjsip show endpoints
Expected result:

Endpoint:  fxo1  Not in use  Auth: fxo1/********
Registration:  fxo1 Registered
And in HT813 web UI → Status page:

FXO  Idle  fxo1  Registered
⚠️ Common gotchas:

Make sure FreePBX and HT813 are on the same LAN (no NAT between).

FreePBX sometimes blocks ATA with Fail2Ban → check /var/log/asterisk/full for “rejected due to authentication error.”

Don’t mix Trunk + Extension for the same FXO → use Extension method unless you plan to integrate PSTN as a real trunk.

👉 Question:
Do you want your FXO line (PSTN) to behave like an incoming trunk to FreePBX (so all calls on PSTN go into PBX), or do you just want the FXO registered as an extension?

That changes whether we configure it as a Trunk or an Extension.

ChatGPT said:
Perfect dump 👌 Thanks, this tells the story.

Your HT813 is reaching FreePBX (Avail 9ms RTT ✅), but it’s not authenticating properly, so FreePBX keeps warning:

WARNING[5712]: res_pjsip_registrar.c:1080 find_registrar_aor: AOR '' not found for endpoint 'HT813_FXO'
That means FreePBX sees the ATA, but the registration attempt has no AOR (no SIP user ID tied to it).

🔎 The cause
In FreePBX you created a Trunk named HT813_FXO, but HT813 is behaving like an extension (it tries to register).
That’s why Asterisk says "AOR '' not found" — there’s no extension fxo1 defined.

✅ Fix: treat HT813’s FXO like an extension
In FreePBX GUI → Applications → Extensions → Add Extension → Add New PJSIP Extension

User Extension: fxo1

Display Name: HT813 FXO

Secret: SuperSecret123 (same as ATA config)

Advanced: leave defaults

Save + Apply Config.

In HT813 FXO SIP settings:

Primary SIP Server: 192.168.1.135 (FreePBX IP)

SIP User ID: fxo1

Authenticate ID: fxo1

Authenticate Password: SuperSecret123

SIP Registration: Yes

Save + Reboot.

🔍 Verify after reboot
On FreePBX CLI:

pjsip show endpoints
You should see:

Endpoint:  fxo1  Not in use   0 of inf
   InAuth:  fxo1-auth/fxo1
   Aor:     fxo1  1
   Contact: fxo1/sip:fxo1@192.168.1.79:5060 Avail ...
And in HT813 web UI → Status:

FXO  Idle   fxo1   Registered
🔄 Next step after registration
In FreePBX → Inbound Routes, route the FXO extension to a destination (e.g., ring a group or IVR).

In Outbound Routes, use FXO extension as a trunk to call out via PSTN.

⚠️ Right now you mixed “Trunk” and “Extension.” The ATA’s FXO should always register as an extension, not a trunk.

👉 Do you want me to give you the exact FreePBX inbound/outbound route configs so your ISP line on FXO can receive and make calls through PBX?

You said:
Authenticate ID: fxo1     in pbx are only numbers 
ChatGPT said:
Exactly 👍 — FreePBX GUI only allows numbers for extensions (e.g., 1001, 2000), while your HT813 needs to register using that same numeric extension.

So instead of using fxo1, you must pick a numeric ID.

🔧 Correct way
In FreePBX → Applications → Extensions → Add Extension → Add New PJSIP Extension

User Extension: 2000 (example, any unused number)

Display Name: HT813 FXO

Secret: MyStrongPass!

In HT813 → FXO Port Settings:

SIP User ID: 2000

Authenticate ID: 2000

Authenticate Password: MyStrongPass!

Primary SIP Server: 192.168.1.135 (FreePBX IP)

SIP Registration: Yes

Save and reboot the HT813.

✅ What should happen
HT813 Status → FXO will show:

Port: FXO   Status: Idle   User ID: 2000   Registration: Registered
FreePBX CLI:

pjsip show endpoints
will list:

Endpoint:  2000/2000   Not in use   0 of inf
   InAuth:  2000-auth/2000
   Aor:     2000   1
   Contact: 2000/sip:2000@192.168.1.79:5060 Avail ...
👉 After this, the FXO line will be usable inside FreePBX like a normal extension.
Then we’ll just need to create Inbound Route (to handle calls from PSTN) and Outbound Route (to send PBX calls out via FXO).

Do you want me to walk you through those two routes step by step?

Perfect 👌 thanks for posting the full output.

Here’s what it tells us:

✅ Your HT813 is visible to FreePBX:

Endpoint:  HT813_FXO   Contact: sip:fxo1@192.168.1.79:5060   Avail
So the PBX can talk to it (ping OK, latency 6ms).

❌ But it is not registered — there’s no InAuth/AOR binding because you set it up as a Trunk (HT813_FXO/fxo1), not as an Extension.
That’s why the Registration column in HT813 GUI still says Not Registered.

🔧 What to do now
You have 2 options, depending on how you want to use the FXO line:

Option A – Register FXO as an Extension (recommended)
In FreePBX → Applications → Extensions → Add PJSIP Extension

User Extension: e.g. 2000

Display Name: HT813 FXO

Secret: MyStrongPass

In HT813 → FXO SIP Settings

SIP User ID: 2000

Authenticate ID: 2000

Password: MyStrongPass

Primary SIP Server: 192.168.1.135

Then HT813 will show Registered, and FreePBX CLI will show:

Endpoint:  2000/2000   Registered
Now you can route inbound calls from PSTN → an IVR, Ring Group, etc.
And for outbound, you can set up an Outbound Route that sends calls through extension 2000.

Option B – Keep it as a Trunk
You can keep the HT813_FXO trunk definition, but in that case:

You must disable registration in HT813 (set SIP Registration = No)

Use the trunk just for routing inbound/outbound calls

FreePBX won’t show it as “registered,” but it will still forward calls to/from the FXO port

This is a bit trickier to maintain, which is why most admins use Option A (Extension mode).

⚠️ Right now you are in-between (HT813 tries to register, FreePBX expects a trunk, so they don’t match).

👉 Do you want me to write you the exact step-by-step FreePBX inbound/outbound route configs for Option A (extension mode) so your PSTN line works right away?

You said:
that sip trunk created in pbx was preventing it from registering once i deleted the sip trunk and kept ext it registred
ChatGPT said:
💯 Exactly — you nailed it!

That SIP trunk you created was “claiming” the HT813’s SIP identity, so when the ATA tried to register as an extension, FreePBX got confused (it saw both a trunk and an extension with the same SIP username).

Once you removed the trunk and kept only the extension, registration worked right away ✅.
Now HT813’s FXO port is officially an extension inside FreePBX, just like a softphone or IP phone.

🔜 Next Steps for You
Now that it’s registered, you just need to make sure PSTN calls flow in/out properly:

Inbound Calls (PSTN → FreePBX)

In FreePBX → Connectivity → Inbound Routes

Create a new inbound route using the DID = extension number you gave to the FXO (e.g., 2000).

Destination → Ring Group, Extension, or IVR.

Save & Apply.
✅ Now when someone calls your analog number, FreePBX will answer and route the call.

Outbound Calls (FreePBX → PSTN)

In FreePBX → Connectivity → Outbound Routes

Add new route, set dial pattern (e.g. 0|. to strip a 0 and send the rest).

Choose Trunk Sequence = extension 2000 (your HT813 FXO).

Save & Apply.
✅ Now your extensions can dial out via the PSTN line.

🔍 Double-check HT813 web UI → Status → FXO: it should say

Port: FXO
User ID: 2000
Registration: Registered
Do you want me to give you a concrete FreePBX dial plan (inbound + outbound route with sample patterns) so you can test calls immediately?

Good observation 👍 — that “FXS Registered” in the HT813 Status page is a bit confusing. Let me explain what’s happening:

🔎 Why does FXS show “Registered” even if Account Active = No?
The HT813 has two independent SIP stacks:

FXS port (the analog phone port – acts like a SIP client/extension)

FXO port (the PSTN line – acts like a SIP trunk/extension depending on setup)

Even when you disable the FXS account (Account Active = No), the firmware often still shows “Registered” in Status because:

It reports the FXS stack is up and listening, not that it is actually registered.

In some firmware versions, the status field is misleading — it always shows “Registered” as long as the SIP engine is enabled globally (not truly per-port).

Since you cleared out the SIP Server/User ID under the FXS settings, it isn’t really registered to FreePBX. You can confirm this by running in FreePBX CLI:

pjsip show endpoints
👉 You won’t see the FXS extension there, only your FXO extension (e.g., 1099).

So don’t worry — it’s just a cosmetic bug / mislabel in the HT813 web GUI. The important part is what FreePBX shows.

✅ What matters:
In FreePBX CLI, check:

pjsip show contacts
You should only see your FXO port’s extension (e.g., 1099), not an extra FXS registration.

In HT813 Status:

FXO must show Registered.

Ignore FXS unless you actually plan to use it.

👉 Do you want me to show you how to repurpose the FXS port as a real FreePBX extension (so you can plug in a classic analog phone and use it as another internal SIP phone)? Or you just want FXO for PSTN calls?

Perfect ✅ thanks for pasting the contacts list.

Here’s the breakdown of what you have right now:

1099/sip:1099@192.168.1.79:37386 → That’s your HT813 FXO port, successfully registered to FreePBX 🎉

Other contacts (1000, 1002, 1003, 1006, 1009) → Your SIP softphones/clients.

No entry for the FXS port → which confirms it’s not really registered, even though the HT813 web GUI misleadingly says “Registered.”

So everything is behaving correctly — you can safely ignore the FXS “Registered” line in the ATA status page. It’s just the HT813 firmware showing that the FXS SIP stack is active, not that it’s registered.

✅ Current State
FXO is correctly registered → ready to use for PSTN inbound/outbound.

FXS is not registered (despite the misleading GUI) → it won’t interfere unless you configure it with real SIP credentials.

👉 Question for you:
Do you want to actually use the FXS port to connect a normal analog phone as a FreePBX extension (like an old DECT phone)? Or do you only care about the FXO (PSTN line) integration?

That will decide whether we configure FXS as an extension or just leave it disabled.
